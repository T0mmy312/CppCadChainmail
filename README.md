# CppCadChainmail
This is a stl c++ cad modelling code for generating rolled up large sheets of chainmail for SLS 3d printing (not tested yet!).  

The goal is to make the moast space efficient chainmail for SLS printing.  
FDM printing is theoretically possible, but no recomended because of the large amounts of supports needed for the floating chainlinks.  

There is also a general modeling class for c++ included and some vector calculation tools from my 3d renderer Project.
